          In the old days of mobile development, you could go from mockup to running app without much trouble. Pixels in Photoshop mapped to app pixels. But in the age of different size screens, the process is a little more complicated.

    <h2>Problem</h2>

        <p>
          Apple’s Autolayout lets developers stretch and squish designs to any screen size. But it’s hard for developers to choose the constraints that produce an aesthetic design at all sizes (for example, aligning things <em>visually</em>, not mathematically).
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the simulator doesn’t always cut it. A design feels different in the hand once it’s real and fully interactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          So before each big app release, we polish. This involves a designer and a developer sitting together with the latest build and tweaking until it looks good. But it takes time!

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          The process is this - run to multiple phones, check the layout, adjust a constraint, and run again. But how much to adjust by? Enter the Pointruler. The Pointruler saves time by getting those adjustments right, first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stop eyeballing it, reduce those iterations, and make your designs look great on everything from an iPhone SE to an iPhone X.

      <h2>The right tools</h2>
      <p>
        App design and development has moved on since the pixel-perfect days. It’s no longer about replicating your Photoshops exactly. It’s about having the tools to make informed design decisions to achieve the best experience across different devices.
